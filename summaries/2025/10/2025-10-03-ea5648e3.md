## TL;DR

A 2025 systematic review of 13 randomized trials found that eating nuts can alter the expression of genes involved in inflammation, oxidative stress and vascular health—effects that differ by nut type. While the studies were conducted mainly in adults with cardiovascular or metabolic issues over 6–52 weeks, the findings suggest nuts may act as a dietary tool for “programming” genes toward better health.

## Key Points

- The review (13 RCTs) shows nuts influence gene expression linked to inflammation, oxidative stress and vascular/metabolic pathways.
- Brazil nuts & hazelnuts upregulated antioxidant/anti‑inflammatory genes; pistachios affected glucose‑control and DNA‑protection genes; mixed nuts modulated vascular‑health genes.
- Participants (mostly with cardiovascular or metabolic conditions) consumed 3–60 g/day for 6–52 weeks, showing the effects in real‑world dietary settings.
- Practical guidance: eat a daily handful (~20–30 g) of unsalted mixed nuts as a snack to potentially “tune” your DNA.
- Direct clinical benefits remain unproven; further research is needed, especially in healthy populations.
